We are gathering information about people involved in BRCA research, testing, counseling and advocacy. If you are a researcher, genetic counselor, patient advocate or member of a clinical testing lab please tell us about yourself! We wonâ€™t share your information with anyone, and we can keep you informed about developments to BRCA Exchange and the BRCA Challenge. You can also optionally choose to be indexed and searchable on our website, and so be recognized for your role in better understanding BRCA.
