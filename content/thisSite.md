# About this site

This site provides information on catalogued BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic variants.  By default, it shows variants that have been curated and classified by an international expert panel, the [ENIGMA](http://enigmaconsortium.org/) consortium, to assess their *pathogenicity* (associated disease risk).  Optional settings allow the user to look at unclassified variants.  In most cases, these variants are awaiting expert review, and their pathogenicity has not yet been established.

The <a href="http://brcaexchange.org">BRCA Exchange</a> website is a product of the <a href="https://genomicsandhealth.org/work-products-demonstration-projects/brca-challenge-0">BRCA Challenge</a> of the <a href="https://genomicsandhealth.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a>. The web site and underlying database were developed by Molly Zhang, Charles Markello, Mary Goldman, Brian Craft, Jing Zhu, David Haussler, Melissa Cline and Benedict Paten at the Computational Genomics Lab at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and <a href="http://ratschlab.org/~raetsch">Gunnar R&auml;tsch</a> at <a href="http://www.mskcc.org">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>, and Rachel Liao of the  <a href="https://genomicsandhealth.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a>  with input and feedback from many members of the <a href="https://genomicsandhealth.org/work-products-demonstration-projects/brca-challenge-0">BRCA Challenge</a> working groups.
