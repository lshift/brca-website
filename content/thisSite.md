# About this site

This site provides information on catalogued BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic variants.  By default, it shows variants that have been curated and classified by an international expert panel, the [ENIGMA](http://enigmaconsortium.org/) consortium, to assess their *pathogenicity* (associated disease risk).  Optional settings allow the user to look at unclassified variants.  In most cases, these variants are awaiting expert review, and their pathogenicity has not yet been established.

The BRCA Exchange website was developed by the [BRCA Challenge](https://genomicsandhealth.org/work-products-demonstration-projects/brca-challenge-0) of the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](https://genomicsandhealth.org/).  The web site and underlying database were developed by the Computational Genomics Lab at the [UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute](https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/)
